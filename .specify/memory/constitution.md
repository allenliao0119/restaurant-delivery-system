# Food Delivery System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality & Maintainability

**Code MUST be production-ready, maintainable, and secure.**

- All code MUST follow consistent style guidelines and pass linting checks
- All code MUST be reviewed for security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Functions and modules MUST have single, clear responsibilities (SRP)
- Complex logic MUST be documented with inline comments explaining "why", not "what"
- No hardcoded credentials, API keys, or sensitive data in source code
- Dead code and unused dependencies MUST be removed before merge
- Code duplication MUST be refactored using DRY principles
- All public APIs and interfaces MUST have clear documentation

**Rationale**: Poor code quality leads to technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and
increased maintenance burden. Food delivery systems handle sensitive customer data,
payment information, and real-time operations requiring bulletproof reliability.

### II. Testing Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**All features MUST be tested before deployment.**

- **Test-First Development**: Write tests BEFORE implementation when feasible
  - Unit tests for business logic and data models
  - Integration tests for service interactions and API contracts
  - Contract tests for external API boundaries
- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% code coverage for critical paths (payment, order processing, auth)
- **Test Categories MUST include**:
  - Happy path scenarios
  - Edge cases and boundary conditions
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Concurrency and race conditions (for real-time features)
- Tests MUST be automated and run in CI/CD pipeline
- Flaky tests MUST be fixed immediately or removed
- All tests MUST pass before code review approval

**Rationale**: Food delivery systems operate in real-time with multiple concurrent
users (customers, drivers, restaurants). Bugs in production directly impact revenue,
customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. Comprehensive testing is the only way
to ensure reliability at scale.

### III. User Experience Consistency

**All user-facing features MUST provide consistent, intuitive experiences.**

- **Response Time Standards**:
  - UI interactions: < 100ms feedback (loading states, button clicks)
  - API responses: < 500ms for p95 latency
  - Real-time updates: < 2s for order status changes
- **Error Handling**:
  - All errors MUST show clear, actionable messages to users
  - No technical stack traces or raw error codes exposed to end users
  - Graceful degradation when third-party services fail
- **Design Consistency**:
  - Reusable UI components across all user types (customer, driver, restaurant)
  - Consistent navigation patterns and information hierarchy
  - Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 Level AA) for all interfaces
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
  - Features MUST work consistently across web, iOS, and Android
  - Mobile-first responsive design for all web interfaces

**Rationale**: Food delivery involves three distinct user types with different needs
but shared expectations for speed and reliability. Inconsistent UX leads to user confusion,
support burden, and abandoned orders.

### IV. Performance Requirements

**System MUST maintain performance under load and scale gracefully.**

- **Scalability Targets**:
  - Support 1,000 concurrent orders during peak hours
  - Handle 10,000 active users without degradation
  - Database queries MUST complete in < 100ms for p95
- **Optimization Requirements**:
  - API endpoints MUST implement pagination for list operations
  - Heavy computations MUST be asynchronous (order routing, analytics)
  - Caching strategy MUST be implemented for frequently accessed data
  - Database indexes MUST exist for all query filter fields
- **Monitoring & Observability**:
  - All critical operations MUST emit structured logs
  - Real-time metrics for order processing latency
  - Alerts for performance degradation (response time, error rate)
  - Distributed tracing for multi-service operations
- **Resource Constraints**:
  - API server: < 500MB memory per instance
  - Database connections pooled and reused
  - File uploads limited to reasonable sizes (10MB max)

**Rationale**: Delivery timing is critical to food quality and customer satisfaction.
Performance issues directly translate to longer delivery times, reduced driver efficiency,
and lost revenue. The system must handle peak meal times (lunch, dinner) reliably.

## Development Standards

### Code Review Requirements

- All code MUST be reviewed by at least one other developer
- Reviewers MUST verify constitution compliance:
  - Security checks completed
  - Tests written and passing
  - Performance considerations addressed
  - UX consistency maintained
- PRs MUST include:
  - Clear description of changes and rationale
  - Test evidence (screenshots, test output)
  - Performance impact assessment for backend changes
  - Migration plan if breaking changes involved

### Technology & Architecture

- **Modularity**: Features SHOULD be self-contained with clear boundaries
- **API-First**: Backend logic MUST be accessible via well-defined REST/GraphQL APIs
- **Database**: Use transactions for multi-step operations (order creation, payment)
- **Authentication**: Industry-standard auth (OAuth2, JWT) with proper token expiration
- **Data Privacy**: PII MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit

### Dependency Management

- New dependencies MUST be justified and approved
- Dependencies MUST be actively maintained (updates within 6 months)
- Security vulnerabilities in dependencies MUST be patched within 1 week of disclosure
- Lock files MUST be committed to ensure reproducible builds

## Code Review & Quality Gates

### Pre-Merge Checklist

Before any code can be merged to main branch:

- ✅ All automated tests pass
- ✅ Code coverage meets minimum thresholds
- ✅ Linting and formatting checks pass
- ✅ Security scan shows no high/critical vulnerabilities
- ✅ Code review approved by at least one maintainer
- ✅ Performance impact assessed and acceptable
- ✅ Documentation updated (if API/behavior changes)

### Deployment Gates

Before deployment to production:

- ✅ Feature tested in staging environment
- ✅ Load testing completed for high-traffic features
- ✅ Rollback plan documented
- ✅ Monitoring alerts configured
- ✅ Stakeholders notified of significant changes

## Governance

### Constitution Authority

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. Any conflicts
between this constitution and other documentation MUST be resolved in favor of the
constitution.

### Amendment Process

1. Proposed amendments MUST be documented with clear rationale
2. Amendments MUST be reviewed and approved by project maintainers
3. Major amendments require project-wide notification and discussion period
4. All dependent templates and documentation MUST be updated to reflect amendments
5. Version number MUST be incremented according to semantic versioning:
   - **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible changes (removing principles, major redefinitions)
   - **MINOR**: Additions (new principles, expanded guidance)
   - **PATCH**: Clarifications, typo fixes, non-semantic changes

### Compliance Review

- All pull requests MUST verify constitution compliance
- Complexity that violates principles MUST be explicitly justified
- Unjustified complexity or constitution violations MUST be rejected in code review
- Quarterly review of constitution effectiveness and potential updates

### Complexity Justification

Any architectural decision that increases system complexity MUST be justified by:

1. **Clear problem statement**: What problem requires this complexity?
2. **Simpler alternatives evaluated**: Why were simpler approaches insufficient?
3. **Long-term benefit analysis**: How does this complexity pay for itself over time?
4. **Maintenance impact**: Who will maintain this and what knowledge is required?

Examples requiring justification:
- Adding new microservices or architectural layers
- Introducing new programming languages or frameworks
- Complex caching strategies
- Custom-built solutions when open-source alternatives exist
