# Feature Specification: Food Delivery Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-delivery-platform`
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I need to create a comprehensive system specification document for a food delivery platform. The main user roles and their functions include: 1. Customer: Browse restaurants, place orders, track orders, make payments 2. Restaurant Owner: Manage menu, receive orders, prepare food, update order status 3. Delivery Driver: Accept orders, pick up food, deliver food, update delivery status 4. Platform Administrator: Manage users, handle disputes, monitor system, analyze data"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Customer Order Journey (Priority: P1)

A customer browses available restaurants, selects food items, places an order, makes payment, and tracks the order until delivery.

**Why this priority**: This is the core revenue-generating flow. Without this, the platform has no business value. It represents the complete customer experience from discovery to delivery.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a mock restaurant, placing an order through payment, and tracking it to completion. Delivers immediate value as customers can receive food.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer opens the app, **When** they browse restaurants by location, **Then** they see a list of available restaurants within their delivery area sorted by estimated delivery time
2. **Given** a customer selects a restaurant, **When** they view the menu, **Then** they see all available items with prices, descriptions, images, and customization options
3. **Given** a customer adds items to cart, **When** they proceed to checkout, **Then** they see order summary with itemized costs, delivery fee, taxes, and total amount
4. **Given** a customer completes payment, **When** the order is confirmed, **Then** they receive an order confirmation with estimated delivery time and can track order status in real-time
5. **Given** an order is in progress, **When** the customer views order tracking, **Then** they see current status (confirmed, preparing, picked up, in transit, delivered) with live driver location when applicable
6. **Given** an order is delivered, **When** the customer confirms receipt, **Then** they can rate the restaurant and driver, and view receipt

---

### User Story 2 - Restaurant Order Management (Priority: P1)

A restaurant owner receives incoming orders, manages menu availability, updates food preparation status, and communicates order readiness to drivers.

**Why this priority**: Without restaurants accepting and preparing orders, the platform cannot fulfill customer orders. This is the supply side of the marketplace and equally critical to P1 customer journey.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating customer orders, allowing restaurant to accept/reject, update preparation status, and mark orders ready for pickup. Delivers value as restaurants can process orders.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new order is received, **When** the restaurant views it, **Then** they see complete order details including items, quantities, customizations, special instructions, customer info, and requested delivery time
2. **Given** a restaurant receives an order, **When** they accept it, **Then** the customer receives confirmation and the order moves to "preparing" status with estimated ready time
3. **Given** a restaurant is preparing an order, **When** they update the status, **Then** the customer sees updated preparation progress and estimated completion time
4. **Given** food is ready, **When** the restaurant marks it ready for pickup, **Then** available drivers are notified and can accept the delivery
5. **Given** a restaurant needs to modify operating hours or menu, **When** they make changes, **Then** updates are reflected immediately to customers browsing the restaurant
6. **Given** a restaurant cannot fulfill an order, **When** they reject it with reason, **Then** the customer is notified immediately and receives automatic refund

---

### User Story 3 - Driver Delivery Workflow (Priority: P1)

A delivery driver goes online, receives delivery requests, accepts deliveries, navigates to restaurant and customer locations, and completes deliveries.

**Why this priority**: Without drivers, orders cannot be delivered to customers. This completes the three-sided marketplace (customer, restaurant, driver) required for basic platform operation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating mock orders ready for pickup, allowing driver to accept, navigate using map integration, update pickup/delivery status, and complete delivery. Delivers value as orders reach customers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a driver is available, **When** they toggle online status, **Then** they become eligible to receive delivery requests in their service area
2. **Given** an order is ready for pickup, **When** a driver receives the request, **Then** they see pickup location, delivery location, estimated distance, estimated time, and delivery fee
3. **Given** a driver accepts a delivery, **When** they navigate to restaurant, **Then** they see turn-by-turn navigation and estimated arrival time
4. **Given** a driver arrives at restaurant, **When** they confirm pickup, **Then** the order status updates to "picked up" and customer sees driver location
5. **Given** a driver is en route to customer, **When** they navigate to delivery address, **Then** they see turn-by-turn navigation and can contact customer if needed
6. **Given** a driver arrives at delivery location, **When** they complete delivery, **Then** they confirm delivery (photo/signature if required), customer is notified, payment is processed, and driver earnings are updated
7. **Given** a driver completes delivery, **When** they return to available status, **Then** they can view earnings summary for completed delivery and become eligible for new requests

---

### User Story 4 - Customer Account Management (Priority: P2)

A customer creates an account, manages delivery addresses, saves payment methods, views order history, and manages preferences.

**Why this priority**: While essential for user experience and retention, the platform can function with guest checkouts initially. This enhances convenience and enables personalization.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating account, adding multiple addresses and payment methods, placing orders, and verifying history. Delivers value through saved preferences and faster checkout.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user opens the app, **When** they sign up, **Then** they can create account using email/phone with verification, or social login
2. **Given** a customer has an account, **When** they add delivery addresses, **Then** they can save multiple addresses with labels (home, work) and set a default
3. **Given** a customer checks out, **When** they add a payment method, **Then** they can save credit/debit cards, digital wallets, or other payment options securely
4. **Given** a customer has order history, **When** they view past orders, **Then** they see all previous orders with dates, restaurants, items, amounts, and can reorder with one tap
5. **Given** a customer uses the platform, **When** they manage preferences, **Then** they can set dietary restrictions, favorite restaurants, notification preferences, and language

---

### User Story 5 - Restaurant Profile and Menu Management (Priority: P2)

A restaurant owner creates and manages their restaurant profile, menu items, pricing, availability, operating hours, and promotional offers.

**Why this priority**: While critical for restaurant operations, basic menu management can be handled manually initially. This enables restaurants to maintain accurate, dynamic menus and attract customers.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by restaurant creating profile, adding menu categories and items with images/descriptions, setting prices, managing availability, and updating operating hours. Delivers value through professional restaurant presence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new restaurant joins, **When** they create their profile, **Then** they provide restaurant name, description, cuisine type, location, contact info, business hours, and upload logo/photos
2. **Given** a restaurant manages menu, **When** they add items, **Then** they organize items into categories, add names, descriptions, prices, images, dietary tags, and customization options
3. **Given** a restaurant has menu items, **When** items become unavailable, **Then** they can mark items out of stock and customers cannot order them
4. **Given** a restaurant wants to run promotions, **When** they create offers, **Then** they can set discounts, minimum order amounts, valid time periods, and customers see offers when browsing
5. **Given** a restaurant needs to close temporarily, **When** they update operating status, **Then** customers see "currently closed" and cannot place orders until reopened

---

### User Story 6 - Payment Processing and Financial Settlement (Priority: P2)

The platform processes customer payments, handles refunds, manages restaurant payouts, calculates driver earnings, and tracks commission fees.

**Why this priority**: Critical for business operations but can be handled with basic payment processing initially. Automated settlements and detailed financial tracking enable scalable operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by processing orders with various payment methods, issuing refunds for cancelled orders, calculating restaurant/driver payouts after commission, and generating financial reports. Delivers value through accurate financial tracking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer places an order, **When** they complete payment, **Then** payment is authorized, funds are held, and confirmation is sent
2. **Given** an order is completed, **When** delivery is confirmed, **Then** payment is captured and allocated to restaurant (minus commission) and driver (delivery fee)
3. **Given** an order is cancelled, **When** refund is initiated, **Then** customer receives full refund according to cancellation policy timeline
4. **Given** a restaurant completes orders, **When** payout period ends (weekly/monthly), **Then** restaurant receives settlement with itemized breakdown of orders and commission deducted
5. **Given** a driver completes deliveries, **When** they request payout, **Then** they see earnings breakdown and receive payment via their preferred method
6. **Given** a payment fails, **When** the error occurs, **Then** customer is notified immediately and can retry with different payment method

---

### User Story 7 - Rating and Review System (Priority: P3)

Customers rate and review restaurants and drivers after delivery, restaurants and drivers view their ratings, and the platform uses ratings for quality control.

**Why this priority**: Important for quality and trust but not required for basic platform operation. Ratings drive improvement and help customers make informed choices.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing orders, allowing customers to submit ratings (1-5 stars) and written reviews, displaying ratings on restaurant/driver profiles, and calculating average ratings. Delivers value through quality feedback loop.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer receives their order, **When** they rate the experience, **Then** they can rate restaurant (1-5 stars), rate driver (1-5 stars), and optionally write reviews for each
2. **Given** a customer writes a review, **When** they submit it, **Then** the review is visible to other customers after moderation, and restaurant/driver is notified
3. **Given** a restaurant has ratings, **When** customers browse, **Then** they see average rating, number of reviews, and can filter/sort restaurants by rating
4. **Given** a driver has ratings, **When** they view their profile, **Then** they see average rating, recent feedback, and performance metrics
5. **Given** ratings fall below threshold, **When** the platform reviews performance, **Then** automated alerts are sent and account may be flagged for review

---

### User Story 8 - Platform Administration and Monitoring (Priority: P3)

Platform administrators manage user accounts, monitor platform health, handle disputes, analyze business metrics, and configure platform settings.

**Why this priority**: Essential for long-term operations but can be handled manually initially. Enables effective platform management at scale.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by administrators accessing dashboard, viewing real-time metrics, managing user accounts, reviewing disputes, and adjusting platform settings. Delivers value through operational control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator logs in, **When** they view the dashboard, **Then** they see real-time metrics including active orders, online drivers, active restaurants, revenue, and system health
2. **Given** a customer dispute is submitted, **When** administrator reviews it, **Then** they see complete order details, customer complaint, restaurant/driver response, and can take actions (refund, warning, suspension)
3. **Given** an administrator manages users, **When** they search accounts, **Then** they can view, edit, suspend, or delete customer, restaurant, or driver accounts
4. **Given** an administrator configures platform, **When** they adjust settings, **Then** they can set commission rates, delivery fees, service areas, operational hours, and feature toggles
5. **Given** an administrator analyzes performance, **When** they generate reports, **Then** they can view analytics on orders, revenue, user growth, popular restaurants, driver performance, and customer satisfaction
6. **Given** fraudulent activity is detected, **When** administrator investigates, **Then** they can view suspicious patterns, transaction history, and take enforcement actions

---

### User Story 9 - Real-time Order Tracking and Notifications (Priority: P2)

All users receive real-time notifications about order status changes, customers track driver location live, and all parties can communicate when needed.

**Why this priority**: Significantly enhances user experience but platform can function with basic status updates initially. Real-time tracking reduces anxiety and support requests.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by placing order, verifying all parties receive notifications at each status change, tracking live driver location on map, and testing in-app messaging. Delivers value through transparency and communication.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an order status changes, **When** any update occurs, **Then** customer receives push notification and in-app update with new status
2. **Given** a driver is en route, **When** customer views tracking, **Then** they see driver's live location on map updating every few seconds with estimated arrival time
3. **Given** a delivery is delayed, **When** estimated time changes, **Then** customer receives notification with updated ETA and reason if available
4. **Given** any party needs to communicate, **When** they send a message, **Then** recipient receives notification and can respond through in-app chat or call
5. **Given** critical updates occur, **When** order is accepted, ready for pickup, picked up, or delivered, **Then** all relevant parties (customer, restaurant, driver) receive immediate notifications

---

### User Story 10 - Search, Filter, and Discovery (Priority: P3)

Customers search for restaurants or specific foods, filter by cuisine, dietary preferences, ratings, delivery time, and discover new restaurants through recommendations.

**Why this priority**: Enhances discovery and user experience but basic browse functionality suffices initially. Advanced search improves conversion and satisfaction.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by searching for restaurants/dishes, applying multiple filters, viewing personalized recommendations, and verifying results match criteria. Delivers value through improved restaurant discovery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer wants specific food, **When** they search by keyword, **Then** they see restaurants offering matching dishes with items highlighted
2. **Given** a customer has preferences, **When** they apply filters, **Then** they can filter by cuisine type, dietary options (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free), price range, ratings, and delivery time
3. **Given** a customer browses regularly, **When** they view recommendations, **Then** they see personalized suggestions based on order history, location, and popular choices
4. **Given** a customer discovers new restaurants, **When** they view results, **Then** they can see "new on platform", "trending", "highly rated", and "fastest delivery" categories
5. **Given** a customer applies multiple filters, **When** results are displayed, **Then** they can sort by relevance, rating, delivery time, or distance

## Assumptions

Based on the feature description, the following reasonable assumptions have been made:

**Business Model Assumptions**

- Platform operates on tiered commission model (10-25%) based on restaurant monthly order volume
- Delivery fees use dynamic pricing based on demand, time of day, weather, and driver availability
- Surge pricing multipliers automatically incentivize drivers during peak demand periods
- Payment methods supported: credit/debit cards and digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay)
- Restaurants are responsible for food preparation; platform handles discovery, ordering, payment, and delivery coordination
- Initial launch targets urban areas with high restaurant density

**Technical Assumptions**

- Users access platform via mobile apps (iOS/Android) and responsive web application
- Real-time location tracking requires GPS-enabled devices
- Map and navigation features integrate with third-party services (Google Maps, Mapbox, or similar)
- Payment processing integrates with established payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, or regional equivalents)
- Push notifications use platform-native services (APNs for iOS, FCM for Android)
- System will use cloud infrastructure for scalability

**User Behavior Assumptions**

- Customers typically order from restaurants within 5km radius
- Average order preparation time is 20-30 minutes
- Average delivery time is 20-40 minutes depending on distance
- Customers expect delivery time estimates accurate within 10 minutes
- Most customers use digital payment methods; cash on delivery is optional regional feature

## Business Model Decisions

The following business model decisions have been clarified:

**Commission Rate Structure**: Tiered rates based on restaurant size/volume (10-25%). This approach rewards high-volume restaurants with lower commission rates, making the platform more competitive for attracting major restaurant chains while still maintaining fair rates for smaller establishments. The system will track monthly order volume and automatically adjust commission tiers.

**Driver Compensation Model**: Dynamic pricing based on demand/time. Delivery fees will adjust automatically based on current demand, time of day, weather conditions, and driver availability. This approach optimizes driver availability during peak hours and maximizes driver earning potential. The system will use surge multipliers during high-demand periods to incentivize more drivers to come online.

**Payment Methods**: Credit/debit cards + digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay). This provides a modern payment experience optimized for mobile users while keeping integration complexity manageable. All payment processing will be handled through industry-standard payment gateways with PCI DSS compliance.
